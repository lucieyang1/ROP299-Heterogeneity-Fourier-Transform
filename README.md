# ROP299-Heterogeneity-Fourier-Transform
Code for ROP project on "Accelerating Dataset Heterogeneity Assessment with Fourier-Transformed Features". I investigated if an approach using Fourier-transformed features can assess dataset heterogeneity using cluster analysis at a faster speed than using features extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). IRMA X-Ray images/data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/irma-xray-dataset).

Files:
* [irma_dataset_new.py](irma_dataset_new.py) - file used to convert IRMA code into pandas dataframe with body part information.
* [ROP_Main_Code_(Summary).ipynb](ROP_Main_Code_(Summary).ipynb) - shortened version of code used for the experiments
* [ROP_Graphs_and_Plots.ipynb](ROP_Graphs_and_Plots.ipynb) - data visualizations of cluster analysis results
